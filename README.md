The ER Dashboard sample demonstrates the capabilities of multiple Ignite UI controls working together into a single complex view designed for mobile tablet devices. The main part of the sample is several charts displaying different kinds of information about patients admitted to the emergency ward of a hospital. The sample shows how the same information can be displayed in a grid and how to switch between views. Combo boxes are used to select different medical parameters to be displayed dynamically update the data behind the charts. Additional buttons let you change the chart visualization with the same data.
